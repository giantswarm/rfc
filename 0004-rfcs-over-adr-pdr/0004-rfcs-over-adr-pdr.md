# RFC 0004 - RFCs over ADRs and PDRs

This RFC describes the relationship between RFCs, ADRs, and PDRs.

'ADR' refers to Architecture Decision Record, and 'PDR' refers to Product Decision Record. These records, as well as their processes, are currently located in the private Giant Swarm Intranet.

ADRs and PDRs should be superseded by RFCs. This allows for one public process for discussing and recording ideas.

The current ADRs and PDRs should be left as is. If they need to be reconsidered or extended, they can be brought up as new RFCs.
