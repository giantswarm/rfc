# Deploy a cluster into existing network

As a user I would like to deploy a k8s cluster into an existing network within my cloud infrastructure. 

Some customers came with already designed and preconfigured cloud infrastructure and networking. 

Benefits: Since the process of getting trust with cloud infrastructure is slow and discussions might take long and involve multiple parts of the organization we should be as flexible as possible to create first clusters. Once we are in we can still drive change towards a better suiting topology.

Challenges: If we donâ€™t own the network configuration there might be lots of dragons and support and operations will take more time.
