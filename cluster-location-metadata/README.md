# Location metadata for clusters

### Problem statement

We have anecdotal evidence that customers think about our installations in terms of their physical location. They communicate in terms like these (paraphrased):

- the Dublin management cluster
- the dev cluster in Singapore
- the China installation

Some on-prem customers use location identifiers like city names in cluster descriptions.

Relevant user stories in this context could be, to name two examples:

- As a platform admin, I want to check the Kubernetes version of all clusters in a certain location.
- As a service owner, I want to check the deployment status of certain apps in a certain location.

With Cluster API on cloud providers we usually have location indicators in cluster resources, in various places. The proposed solution in this RFC would help simplify and unify location lookup for clusters by clients throughout cloud providers.

In on-premises installations, no location information is currently available in Kubernetes resources. This RFC attempts to change that.

The assumption here is that entire clusters are not distributed geographically, so that the entire cluster can be assigned to one geographical location.

### Decision maker

- Team Honeybadger together with Team Rocket
- Other KaaS teams should consent

### Deadline

None

### Who is affected / stakeholders

TBD

### Preferred solution

The solution proposed here consists of two parts:

- Setting consistent metadata on clusters
- Providing a default location ID system for on-prem customers

#### Consistent metadata on clusters

We should set the [`topology.kubernetes.io/region`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#topologykubernetesioregion) label on the main cluster resource of all clusters. Currently (as of February 2025) this resource is of kind `Cluster`, group=`cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`.

The `topology.kubernetes.io/region` label is documented as w well-known label, set by Kubernetes on `Node` and `PersistentVolume` resources.

For clusters running in cloud providers, the value of the label should be the region identifier. E. g. `eu-west-1` for the AWS datacenter in EU/Dublin.

For clusters on premises, the value should follow a system that we establish for this purpose. The system may differ between customers, to allow fulfilling of customer-specific requirements.

Regardless of the environment (cloud/on-prem), the value of the `topology.kubernetes.io/region` label should not include any whitespace and consist of the lowercase letters, numbers, and dash only (`[a-z0-9-]`).

#### Default location ID system for on-prem

Our default location identification system should be

- easy to use and to understand
- hierarchical
- extensible

Here is a synopsis:

```
<CONTINENT_CODE>-<COUNTRY_CODE>[-<STATE_CODE>][-<CITY_NAME>]
```

Details:

- `CONTINENT_CODE`: The mandatory first part is a two-letter code for the global region/continent. Available are:
  - `af` for Africa
  - `an` for Antarctica (yes, unlikely, but who knows)
  - `as` for Asia
  - `eu` for Europe
  - `na` for North America
  - `oc` for Oceania
  - `sa` for South America
- `COUNTRY_CODE` is the two letter [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code of the country the cluster is located in.
- `STATE_CODE` is the optional code for a subdivision of the country, like it might makes sense for larger countries like the U. S.
- `CITY_NAME` is a concise form of the city name the datacenter is located in.

Depending on the needs for the individual customer, the number of levels in the hierarchy may vary. We should also foresee a change to the naming system after its establishment, e. g. to introduce a state code within one country.

Here are some examples how this system could be applied to identify three different cluster locations:

##### Example 1: Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Europe

- `eu-de-frankfurtmain` - Since Frankfurt is an ambiguous city name, the suffix "main" is added to it to disambiguate.
- `eu-de-he-frankfurt` - `he` as the state code for Hessia. In this regional context, the name "frankfurt" is non-ambigious.

Germany has several cities named "Frankfurt", so without a state code, "frankfurt" alone would be ambigious. Either adding "main" to the city name or adding the state code (`he` for Hessia) solves this.

##### Example 2: Aix-en-Provence, France, Europe

- `eu-fr-aixenprovence` - Here, "aixenprovence" names the city "Aix en Provence" in France in a non-ambiguous way.
- `eu-fr-pac-aix` - `pac` as a region code for "Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur", which has ISO 3166-2 code `FR-PAC`. As the region is narrowed down, the much shorter "aix" can idetify the city clearly.

##### Example 3: Dallas, Texas, United States of America

- `na-us-tx-dallas` - The U.S. have [many citites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(disambiguation)) by the name of Dallas. So the state code should be used to disambiguate.

##### Optional state and city part

The state code and city name parts are optional and should only be applied if relevant to the customer. In case of a customer that tends to create not more than one data center per country, they could be omitted. Examples:

- `eu-fr` for France
- `af-za` for South Africa
- `sa-br` for Brazil

### Alternative solutions

- Instead of `topology.kubernetes.io/region`, we could specify our own label in the `giantswarm.io` namespace.

- Instead of strings, we could introduce a system that provides geo coordinates. (Since the cloud providers already work with string identifiers, this draft oped for a solution that extends this paradigm to on-prem.)

### Implementation plan

Not discussed yet.

One major concern is: if a customer creates a new cluster in a new on-prem facility, how is the location identifier determined? Would the customer have to think about this?

### Communication plan

Not discussed yet.
