# RFC 0014 - Giant Swarm Managed Apps UVP is the transition between DIY and Upstream Enterprise 

Thu, 25. Feb 2021

**What is a Unique Value Proposition (UVP)? It is a (1) distinctive value to (2) a chosen set of customers (3) at the right relative price.**

I realized sth while talking about Falco/Sysdig Secure in the SIG Partner Sync.

**The strategy of all companies w open source products is to upsell (expensive) enterprise support. I wonder how much this strategy makes sense for customers?**

To illustrate, one customer would have a dozen apps (e.g. Kong, Aqua or Sysdig, Grafana Enterprise, Kafka, and I don’t know what else). **Doesn’t it seem too expensive and / or too inefficient to engage in enterprise contracts with each and every one of the companies behind each one?**

I watched yesterday's [SIG Product Marketing Sync](https://gigantic.slack.com/archives/C95NTB55M/p1614169617017800?thread_ts=1614158491.014600&cid=C95NTB55M)

Timo said,

> Why partnering makes sense - We’re offering Loki, Prometheus, Grafana - we don’t see ourself as competitors. We see us as enablers of Grafana. But people DIY first. They do DIY w us first. Then they move on.

Thinking from this perspective, questions for thought:

- Could our ‘unique value proposition’ (UVP) be that we are a transition phase between DIY and upstream enterprise? Until they are sure they have more data that they **need** and **could benefit** from the value upstream enterprise support?
- If the above is true, how does that inform the depth of our management (scalability, performance, SLAs, etc.)?
- If the above is true, how does that inform the depth of our support (level 1? level 2?)?
- If the above is true, how does that inform the types of apps we should offer?
- If the above is true, how does that inform our pricing?
- Are we seeing the enterprise version of the consumer trend ‘subscription fatigue’?
- Is this nonsense? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
