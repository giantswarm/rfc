# Cloud Integration

As a user I would like to manage other cloud resources from my kubernetes clusters.

Tools for that:
 * AWS Kubernetes controllers (ACK) - https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s/community
 * Azure Service Operator - https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator
 * Cross Plane - https://crossplane.io/

Benefits: Manage a bigger landscape of cloud infrastructure
