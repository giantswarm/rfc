# Adopt existing clusters for KaaS management

As a user I can adopt a Kubernetes cluster and have it managed by Giant Swarm 24/7. Clusters can get upgraded to a full Giant Swarm release.

Benefits: The customers donâ€™t have to migrate all their apps to get onto a fully supported cluster by Giant Swarm.

Challenges: We would probably need to do this first: Deploy a cluster into existing VPCs and Subnets (rfc/0005)
