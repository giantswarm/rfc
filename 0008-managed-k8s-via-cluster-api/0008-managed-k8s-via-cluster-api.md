# Managed K8s in our KaaS product

As a User I would like to provision EKS or AKS clusters via Giant Swarm.

Benefits: We use the building block we get from the cloud providers and save effort on our side. ClusterAPI allows this as well.

Challenges: Do we also automate migration of clusters? Do we still offer a non-eks non-aks control plane?
