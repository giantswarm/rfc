# rfc

## Rationale

Giant Swarm is a growing, distributed company, and we want to ensure that everyone continues to have the ability to bring their ideas and thoughts into the hivemind. While a large amount of our discussion currently happens successfully in chats and calls, a long-form writing process provides some benefits, for example: promoting deep thinking and discussion, creating a record of considered ideas and discussion, reducing number of meetings (and allowing easier management of timezones), and providing avenues for increasing the asynchronicity of our work.

Before scheduling a call, or starting a Slack thread, ask yourself whether you could be writing an RFC instead.

All ideas, thoughts, comments, suggestions, and eldritch ramblings, are valid and welcomed as RFCs.

## Process

This repo contains RFCs of Giant Swarm. Please read the [RFC and decision making process](./decision-process) (which itself is an RFC) for how Markdown formatting, creation, discussion and approval/decline works.

When linking to an RFC, please use the [rendered list of RFCs in the handbook](https://handbook.giantswarm.io/docs/rfcs/). Please refrain from treating PR numbers as "RFC number", since we don't have such an identifier. The directory name of an RFC should stay unchanged since it's a permanent part of handbook/GitHub links to the document.

## Visibility

This repository (`giantswarm/rfc`) is public. This is a continuation of Giant Swarm's default position of radical transparency, with the aim to allow all ideas to be shared and discussed openly. Some reasonable efforts may need to be made to ensure sensitive information remains private.
